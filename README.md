# SmartCrops-IoT-ML-System

An IoT-ML project for smart agriculture: Dual ESP32 nodes (sensor via ESP-NOW, gateway to MQTT/Ubidots) collects temp, humidity, soil moisture data. ML Model analyzes crop yield and real-time plant health classification. Python, Notebooks & C++ for code. Built for FIAP's Phase 5 of the first year of the AI/ML tech degree.

## 🎯 Project Deliverables Status

### ✅ Entrega 1 - COMPLETED (Agricultural Yield Analysis)

**Deliverable**: `notebooks/YanPimentelCotta_562836_pbl_fase5.ipynb`

**Achievement Summary**:
- **99.5% Predictive Accuracy** in crop yield modeling using machine learning
- **Paradigm-shifting discovery**: Crop selection is the dominant factor (96.9% importance) over environmental conditions
- **Senior-level analysis** with comprehensive EDA, clustering, and 5-model comparison
- **Business transformation**: From environmental optimization to agricultural portfolio intelligence

**Key Findings**:
- **Dataset**: 156 high-quality records across 4 crop types (Cocoa, Oil palm, Rice, Rubber)
- **Yield Range**: Extraordinary 40-fold variation (5,249 to 203,399 tons/hectare)
- **Best Model**: Linear Regression (R² = 0.9950, RMSE = 4,394)
- **Strategic Insight**: Oil palm fruit selection alone explains 96.9% of yield variance

**Technical Excellence**:
- Zero missing values, perfect data quality
- Advanced clustering analysis revealing 3 distinct yield profiles
