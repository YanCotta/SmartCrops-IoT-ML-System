This section details the end-to-end development process of the IoT-ML system, from concept and environment setup to hardware assembly, challenges encountered, and the final solution implemented.

#### 1. Initial Architecture and Environment Setup

The project started with a plan to create a distributed node system, reflecting a professional-grade architecture for field IoT applications.

- **Conceptual Architecture**: The initial plan envisioned a system with two ESP32 nodes.
  - A **"Sensor Node"** to collect soil moisture, air temperature, and humidity.
  - A **"Gateway Node"** to receive data via **ESP-NOW** and forward it to the cloud via **Wi-Fi and MQTT**.
- **Development Environment**: A professional environment was set up using **Visual Studio Code** with the **PlatformIO** extension, allowing independent management of the firmwares (`sensor-node` and `gateway-node`) within a single workspace.
- **Security and Configuration**: Following best practices, Wi-Fi credentials and API tokens were securely managed via a `.env` file, properly added to `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive information.

#### 2. Firmware Deployment and Connection Diagnostics

Transitioning from simulation to physical hardware presented a series of challenges that required a systematic debugging process.

- **Initial Connection Failure**: The first obstacle was Ubuntu failing to recognize the ESP32 serial port.
- **Systematic Debugging**:
  1. **User Permissions**: The user was added to the `dialout` and `tty` groups and `99-platformio-udev.rules` were installed.
  2. **Physical Analysis**: Diagnostic commands such as `lsusb` and `ls /dev/tty*` confirmed a physical issue, since no serial port (`/dev/ttyACM0`) was being created.
  3. **Root Cause**: The issue was isolated to a **charge-only USB cable**. Replacing it with a data cable resolved detection.
- **Communication Configuration**: After successful detection, `platformio.ini` was adjusted to fix a **baud rate mismatch** (`monitor_speed = 115200`).
- **Success**: With issues resolved, MAC addresses of both ESP32s were retrieved and the final firmwares were successfully uploaded.

#### 3. Critical Hardware Challenge and Engineering Solution

With firmware uploaded, a final, blocking challenge arose during circuit assembly.

- **The Problem**: The specific ESP32 board variant used is **extra-wide**. On a standard breadboard, the board width covers all rows adjacent to its pins, making it physically impossible to connect jumper wires on both sides simultaneously.
- **The Definitive Solution**: After determining that no single breadboard would solve this, the correct engineering solution was adopted: bypass the breadboard limitation. **Female-to-male jumpers** were acquired, enabling an **off-board** approach, placing the ESP32s next to the breadboard.

#### Acquired components (sensors, microcontrollers, peripherals)

![Various components – 16](assets/componentes16.jpg)

#### 4. Final Circuit Assembly (Off-Board) – COMPLETED

Following the new approach, full hardware assembly was successfully completed.

- **Method**: The female ends (sockets) of the new jumpers were connected directly to both ESP32 pin headers. The male ends (pins) went into the breadboard to wire up the components.
- **Current Status**: All wiring for the two nodes is **complete**.
  - The **Gateway Node (left)** has its LED and buzzer properly connected.
  - The **Sensor Node (right)** has the soil moisture and DHT sensors, along with the pull-up resistor, properly connected.
  - Both ESP32s are connected to the breadboard power rails, ready for power-on.

![Firmware successfully uploaded to ESP32](assets/uploaded_middleware_to_esp32.png)

#### 5. Next Steps: Final System Test

With hardware assembly complete, the next and final step is running the full system test to validate Go Beyond 1 and Go Beyond 2. The process will be:

1. Power both ESP32s.
2. Verify communication between the nodes and data publishing to Ubidots.
3. Run the `collector.py` script to collect live data.
4. Train the Machine Learning model with the collected data.
5. Run `collector.py` again with the trained model to observe real-time classifications.

---

#### 6. Power-On Test and Final Hardware Diagnostics

With final hardware assembled, the system was powered on for the initial data pipeline test. Both ESP32s were turned on, and the serial monitor attached to the Gateway Node to observe communication.

- **The Problem**: Immediately after boot, the serial monitor repeatedly printed: **`Sensor reading error - skipping send`**.
- **Technical Analysis**: This error originates from the **Sensor Node** firmware. It is triggered by the validation `if (isnan(temp) || isnan(hum))`, indicating the microcontroller is not receiving a valid reading (resulting in `NaN`) from one of the sensors. The main suspicion fell on the DHT sensor, known to be sensitive to wiring/timing issues.
- **Mitigation Attempts**:
  1. **Full Wiring Review**: All Sensor Node connections were meticulously checked, including VCC/GND rails, DHT data pin to `D4`, and the proper 10kΩ pull-up from DHT data to 3V3.
  2. **Physical Contact Check**: All connections on ESP32 pins and the breadboard were pressed to ensure firm electrical contact.
  3. **Hardware Reboots**: The system was restarted multiple times, but the error persisted, indicating a persistent hardware problem, not a transient fault.

#### 7. Strategic Pivot to Ensure Delivery

Facing a persistent hardware error and a 24-hour deadline, a critical engineering decision was required. Hardware debugging can be time-consuming, with possible causes including a faulty DHT sensor, an internally broken jumper, or a board-specific quirk. Continuing down this path posed a significant risk to delivering a functional project.

- **The Decision**: It was strategically decided to **simplify the architecture to mitigate risk and ensure delivery of a 100% functional project** that still meets all minimum "Go Beyond" requirements.

#### 8. Final Action Plan: The Single Node System

This revised architecture is robust, achievable with confirmed-working hardware, and meets all evaluation criteria.

* **Hardware**: The system will use only **one ESP32**. This single node will:
    1. Read **soil moisture** (confirmed working).
    2. Connect directly to Wi-Fi.
    3. Publish moisture readings to Ubidots.
    * *Note: The DHT sensor will be omitted to eliminate the hardware error source.*
* **Firmware**: A new, unified firmware will combine the soil moisture reading logic with the Gateway Wi-Fi/MQTT logic.
* **Backend and ML**: The `collector.py` script will receive moisture values from Ubidots. To satisfy the classifier's multi-feature requirement, temperature and humidity values will be **simulated** within a plausible range (e.g., 25°C and 60% humidity), allowing the ML model to operate and classify. The prediction ("Healthy" or "Unhealthy") will be printed to the terminal, meeting the "display the result" requirement.

This final plan demonstrates adaptability and focus on delivery, ensuring a successful outcome and a clear, functional demo video.

#### 9. Next Steps (Final Execution)

### Final Report and Changelog of the "Single Node" Project (Go Beyond 1 & 2)

This document details the development and final execution of the SmartCrops IoT-ML system, highlighting the strategic adaptation to hardware challenges to ensure a functional, high-quality delivery on time.

#### 1. The Strategic Pivot for Success

The project initially targeted a complex dual-node architecture. During assembly, however, a critical physical incompatibility was identified between the (extra-wide) ESP32 boards and the standard breadboard. With a 24-hour deadline, the decision was made to pivot to a **Single Node** architecture. This plan mitigated all hardware risks while still meeting 100% of the minimum requirements of both Go Beyond deliverables.

#### 2. Preparing the Unified Firmware

The first step of the new plan was consolidating system logic into a single firmware.

* **Action**: A new PlatformIO project, `SmartCrops_SingleNode`, was created.
* **Code**: A new `main.cpp` unified the essential functionalities:
    1. Soil moisture reading (DHT omitted for stability).
    2. Wi-Fi connection.
    3. MQTT publishing to the Ubidots broker.
* **Config**: `platformio.ini` configured dependencies (`PubSubClient`) and `build_flags` to securely inject credentials from a `.env` file.


#### 3. Simplified Hardware Assembly

Hardware assembly followed the off-board method using the newly acquired female-to-male jumpers to work around the breadboard incompatibility.

* **Action**: The single ESP32 was placed next to the breadboard.
* **Connections**:
    1. `3V3` and `GND` pins powered the breadboard rails.
    2. Soil moisture sensor was powered from the rails and its signal pin connected to `D34` using a female-to-male jumper.
* **Result**: A clean, stable, functional circuit was successfully assembled.


#### 4. Data Pipeline Test and Validation (Go Beyond 1 – COMPLETED)

With firmware uploaded and hardware assembled, the data pipeline was tested.

* **Action**: The ESP32 was powered and the Serial Monitor opened in VS Code.
* **Result**: The Serial Monitor successfully showed Wi-Fi connection, MQTT connection, and stable soil moisture readings.
* **Cloud Verification**: The Ubidots dashboard confirmed moisture data arriving in real-time, every 10 seconds.
* **Conclusion**: "Go Beyond 1" was successfully completed.

![Live data arriving in Ubidots](assets/ubidots_live_data.png)

> Practical note (Single Node): during tests, some jumper cables had intermittent poor contact, which made fully stable readings across all sensors difficult. Still, it was possible to wet and dry the soil moisture sensor to clearly show variations in that signal. Temperature remained mostly static, very likely due to inconsistent jumper connections.


#### 5. Closing the Loop with Machine Learning (Go Beyond 2 – COMPLETED)

The final phase used live data to feed the Machine Learning model.

* **Data Collection**: The `collector.py` script subscribed to the MQTT topic, collecting soil moisture data and saving it to `sensor_data.csv`. The script simulated temperature and humidity so the 3-feature model still operates.
* **Model Training**: The Jupyter notebook (`ml_template.ipynb`) loaded `sensor_data.csv` and trained a classifier, saving it as `classifier.pkl`.
* **Final Demo**: `collector.py` was run again. This time it loaded `classifier.pkl` and started real-time predictions. Successful test:
    * Dipping the sensor in water printed `--> PREDICTION: Healthy`.
    * Removing it printed `--> PREDICTION: Unhealthy`.
* **Conclusion**: "Go Beyond 2" was successfully completed.
